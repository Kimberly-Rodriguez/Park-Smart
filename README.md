  ## Description
  Users in a neighborhood can create an account on the Park Smart © app. Once
they are logged in, they are presented with a map of their neighborhood block with
numbered street parking spaces that are color-coded based on if they are taken or
available. Spaces that are green are available and spaces that are red are taken.
Once a user parks in an available space, they click on the designated number on
the app’s map, where they may then choose, “I am parking here” & have the option of
adding what time they plan on leaving. When they submit the form, the space will turn
red & the ‘time available’ will be included as an attribute users can see when they view
the space. Users can also update their ‘leave time’ if they plan on leaving sooner or later
than they originally stated. Other users are now able to edit the spot once they have
parked there.
